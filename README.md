# AAK_HDRP

This is a simple project template that can be used to get started with AAK and HDRP.

AAK is not included in this repository so it has to be copied into the project manually or imported using the package manager. If it is imported using the package manager make sure you dont override project settings during import.

Since AAK Materials are URP they have to be changed. For example SoulsDefault should be changed to HDRP/Lit with the SoulsPalette as its BaseMap.
